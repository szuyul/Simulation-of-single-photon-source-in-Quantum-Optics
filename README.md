# Simulation-of-single-photon-source-in-Quantum-Optics
The script follows the article, "[The First Single Photon Sources and Single Photon Interference Experiments](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337945267_The_First_Single_Photon_Sources_and_Single_Photon_Interference_Experiments)," by Prof. [Alain Aspect](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2022/aspect/facts/), the 2022 Nobel Prize winner in Physics for his contribution in quantum entanglement. This simulation compares the behaviors of a single-photon source made by calcium atom (one photon state) and a classical LED light source (Poisson distribution of number states) in the following contexts:
1. optical spectrum and pulse shape
2. photon emission trace and statistics
3. photon counting SNR of classical source (shot-noise limit)
4. single photon detection (heralded and direct detection)
5. anticorrelation experiment
6. single-photon interference experiment
