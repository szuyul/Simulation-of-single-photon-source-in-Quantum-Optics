# Simulation-of-single-photon-source-in-Quantum-Optics
The script follows the article, "The First Single Photon Sources and Single Photon Interference Experiments," by Prof. Alain Aspect, the 2022 Nobel Prize winner in Physics for his contribution in quantum entanglement. This simulation compares the behaviors of a single-photon source made by calcium atom (one photon state) and a classical LED light source (Poisson distribution of number states) in the following contexts:
1. optical spectrum and pulse shape
2. photon emission trace and statistics
3. photon counting SNR of classical source (shot-noise limit)
4. single photon detection (heralded and direct detection)
5. anticorrelation experiment
6. single-photon interference experiment
